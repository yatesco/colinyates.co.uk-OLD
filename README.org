* About
The repository and 'build framework' for [[http://colinyates.co.uk]].

The goal is to be able to create posts in emacs and then publish them to the jekyll site. 

/org contains the org posts and relevant plumbing
/jekyll contains the jekyll infrastructure and is the 'root' of the jekyll site

This is woefully under cooked at the moment so if you are looking for inspiration, probably best looking elsewhere, at least for now ;-).

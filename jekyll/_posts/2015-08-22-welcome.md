# Hi there...
and welcome. You can find out [more about me and this blog](/about), but in brief I hope to regularly post about Clojure, ClojureScript, Emacs and Software Engineering in general.

This blog will be prose-orientated, tracking my daily experiments to become a better engineer and will be more akin to a diary than a set of scientific papers.

# Next...
will be a case of maturing this blog. At the moment it is pretty bare bones, but you can check my [TODO list](/todo).

So, welcome, and I hope you enjoy the ride.

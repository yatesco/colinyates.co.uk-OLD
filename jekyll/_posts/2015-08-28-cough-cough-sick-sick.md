Unfortunately we (family) have all been under the weather with different grades of sickness. My wife, and now me have a pretty nasty stomach bug which also seems to attack the throat. The kids are all much better but are generally very tired.

Not nice.

All of this is to say that my new-found blog isn't getting off to the best start. 

As the pastor of my [church](http://trinitylifechurch.org.uk/) likes to say:

> Better days are ahead -- [David Hinds](http://trinitylifechurch.org.uk/leaders/), frequently.

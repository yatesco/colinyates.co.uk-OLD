# Moan, moan, moan<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

This is really just a moan, move on - there are almost certainly better things to do with your life.

Still here? Ok, you have been warned.

# Blogging, blogging, blogging<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

I rate [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), it really can seem to do anything, as long as you are happy to build your own editor on top of it. 

I also rate [org-mode](http://orgmode.org), which can also seem to do anything, and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is a <span class="underline">much</span> saner way to create content that end up in HTMLs. And of course [org-mode can publish docs](http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html).

A also decided that I didn't want to hand over my content, so a system which generates a website I can upload to my server is another requirement.

A quick google and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seems to be the number one contender, it supports `markdown`, is a static site generator and everybody seems to rave about it.

# Jekyll<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

Getting started with Jekyll is trivially easy, particularly on a Mac where ruby is installed out of the box. From their start page:

    $ gem install jekyll
    $ jekyll new my-awesome-site
    $ cd my-awesome-site
    $ /my-awesome-site $ jekyll serve
    ;; => Now browse to http://localhost:4000

And it really that easy. In fact, this blog (as of now) is using the default theme - not bad is it? Blog posts require a trivial amount of meta-data and it is even natively understood (indeed, even underpins) [github pages](https://pages.github.com).

# Jekyll and not Hyde<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

So where is the pain?

Well, turns out that when hosted on `github pages` you can't use plugins. Ok, fine, except some pretty fundamental capabilities aren't supported out of the box:

-   tagging
-   tag clouds
-   tag feeds
-   archived pages
-   search

and so on.

Jekyll does support [plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) but they aren't enabled when using `github pages`. There are some pretty neat people out there who have achieved some of the above capabilities using [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) which `jekyll` uses for [templating](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/), for example [here are some](https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Djekyll%2520liquid%2520tags). 

The problem is I can't seem to get them to work. I also can't seem to get any of the [plugin based ones](https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Djekyll%2520tag%2520plugin) to work either.

Is it me? Probably :-), and I confess I haven't spent more than a couple of hours on it, but why on <span class="underline">earth</span> isn't something as fundamental as this supported out of the box?

# Emacs to the rescue<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

Moving on, at least I can look forward to using `emacs` and `org-mode` to integrate with `jekyll`. Look, there are even [official instructions](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html). Except that assumes you have already configured the beast that is `org-mode publishing`. 

Surely there must be an easier HOWTO? Well there [seems to be lots](https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Dorg%2520mode%2520jekyll) only none of those seem to work either! 

Again, is it me? Again, I only spent a few hours on this, but compared to the 5 minutes I spent bootstrapping `jekyll` and creating my first blog post, I am shocked that this stuff is so hard.

# Giving up?<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

At this point I was thinking that maybe I am not the candidate audience as I simply want a blog to work, I don't particularly care <span class="underline">how</span>, only that is `markdown` based and is statically generated. A quick bit of [research](https://staticsitegenerators.net) showed there are plenty in this space and a bit more research showed <https://www.staticgen.com>.

The top 4 at the time I looked were:

-   jekyll
-   [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.com)
-   [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
-   [Hexo](http://hexo.io)

Well, I didn't want to depend on GitHub and Octopress is based on jekyll. Off to Hexo.

# Hexo<a id="orgheadline7"></a>

[Hexo](https://hexo.io) is about as simple as jekyll to get started, and out of the box it supports all the various gadgetry that I want. 

Posts are written in `markdown` with a little big of ceremony at the top, similar to jekyll.

But looking into a little bit more, things just didn't sit well. Nothing specific, but it didn't <span class="underline">vibe</span> with me as much as jekyll.

# So where are we?<a id="orgheadline8"></a>

So, I am going to stick with jekyll and accept I might need to put some more time in than expected. Fine, and it is definitely a nice problem to have compared to the horrors of hosted blogging platforms (which shall remain nameless).

Emacs? Yeah, I am typing this in `org mode` and will manually export it to markdown and then copy and paste.

Yeah, I know.

Anyway, that is the end of my moan. Thanks for reading and hopefully the rest of the posts on this blog will be a bit more educational and upbeat, but please do be prepared for this blog to grow organically as I get used to jekyll ;-).

Bye all.
